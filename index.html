    <h2> Hi! For Our Project We Chose Mooji Meats</h2>
    <div class="questions">
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>Mooji Meats is a startup focused on creating the next generation of alternative meats</li>
                <li>With a custom 3D-print like process, Mooji Meats is able to create plant based meat without 
                    the tradeoff in taste, look, feel, and nutrition </li>
                <li id="logo"><span><img src="logo.png"/></span></li>
                <li>This Project Encompasses 4 Main Parts, 3 Of Which Will be Shown On This Page</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Part 1: Sketching & Wireframing</b></li>

    <h2>Part 1: Sketching & Wireframing</h2>
    <h4>To Get Some Ideas We Started By Making 13 Screen Sketches On What Mooji Meat's Website Could Be:</h4>

    <h4>Using These Sketches We Were Able To Consoloidate Our Design Into a Lofi</h4>

    <h2> Part 2: Mockups </h2>

    <h4>Using The Previous Lofi We Were Able to Make a Hifi Mockup!</h4>

    <h4>We Then Received Critique From Our Peers!</h4>
    <p>A <b class="check">✔</b> means we fixed that feedback in our next hifi!</p>
    <div class="observations">
      <div>
        <ul>
          <li>Professional Critique:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Making a add to cart step instead of taking users directly to the checkout page. <b class="check">✔</b></li>
            <li>Maybe make a small overlay to show what is currently in the user’s cart.</li>
            <li>Rename  the “order” tab to  see your cart, or checkout <b class="check">✔</b></li>
            <li>For Why mooji, try to add more visual  assets to engage the user <b class="check">✔</b></li>
            <li>Iconify, Splash - plugins to add visual assets <b class="check">✔</b></li>
            <li>Reduce the  width of textboxes, make them slimmer and have a  scroll bar instead.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <br>
          <li>Peer Feedback:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Enhance spacing. Ex: the top and bottom margins are a little off. Readjust</li>
            <li>At the bottom, make the icons more consistent. <b class="check">✔</b> </li>
            <li>There is a lot of white space. Incorporate more textboxes to provide more relevant information.</li>
            <li>On the landing page, put the name closer to the logo <b class="check">✔</b></li>

            <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">
            <li>On the order page, break it up into smaller phases instead of one big page. <b class="check">✔</b> </li>
            <li>Bold the headings on the why mooji page and combine some textboxes <b class="check">✔</b></li>
            <li>Add some more pictures since it is advertising food. Maybe the farms, process, 3D printing. Present more stories about how we get the food. Make things look more delicious. <b class="check">✔</b></li>
            <li>On the payment page, if the payment address matches, make the address input boxes disappear. - Also fixed the issue with other “Buy Now” pages not connecting to the overlay <b class="check">✔</b></li>
            <li>Delete the drop shadow if we are not planning on making things clickable on the why mooji page. <b class="check">✔</b></li>
            <li>In the about us page, separate the texts more with text boxes</li>
            <li>Make the shopping cart more noticeable on the products page <b class="check">✔</b></li>
            <li>Add logo and formatting on the navBar to help with branding and memorability <b class="check">✔</b></li>
            <li>On the products page, make a “add to cart” button instead of having the shopping cart directly take you to the checkout screen</li>

    <h2>Part 3: User Testing</h2>

    <h4> Using UserTesting.com We Conducted User Testing By Giving Them This Overarching Task</h4>
    <div class="questions">
      <div>
        <ul>
          <li>Overarching Task</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Imagine you are a recently converted vegan who is craving meat and interested in finding a vegan meat alternative. Navigate to the 'Why Mooji?' page and summarize the main benefits of Mooji meat products.</li>
            <li>Afterwards, navigate to the shopping cart and order the existing item in the cart. Since this is an interactive mock-up, there will be a pre-filled item present there for you to checkout. Please think aloud as you perform these tasks, describing your thought process as you navigate and interact with each page</li>
            <li>This is not an actual website, but an interactive mockup made on a prototyping software.</li>
          </ul>
          <li> Extra Tasks</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Task 1: Without leaving the homepage, what are your initial impressions of the website? Explain your answer.</li>
            <li>Task 2: Without leaving this page, in your own words, describe what do you think you can do on this website.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
      </div>      
  </div>

  <h4> Testing Results</h4>
    <div class="questions">
      <div>
        <ul>
          <li> Users</li>
          <ul>
           <li><b>User1:</b> completed all tasks, no errors, told us to fix payment page, understood the company after the home page and got the general concept of the mock up</li>
           <li><b>User2:</b> didn’t complete the task, understood the company after looking at homepage</li>
           <li><b>User3:</b> understood the company after looking at the homepage, understood the concept of the mock up, completed the checkout successfully</li>
          </ul>
          <li> Summary</li>
          <ul>
          All of the users had a good understanding of what the company was about and the main problem that we were trying to solve. They were able to correctly identify the main purpose of the website (buying alternative meats) without leaving the homepage, and they were able to navigate to the correct pages to do so. One of the main errors we saw was during the actual checkout process, where a common complaint was that the page was rather overwhelming. This was actually in line with our expectations, since that was the same feedback we received from the studio critiques. To address this, we did make some changes to the final interface, splitting up the checkout section into multiple pages so that the user does not feel as overwhelmed. Overall, the user testing did line up with our expectations and the users did well in most of their tasks.
